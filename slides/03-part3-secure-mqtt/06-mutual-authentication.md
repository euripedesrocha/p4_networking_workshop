# Mutual Authentication (mTLS)

## Bidirectional Certificate Verification

### Traditional TLS (Server-only)
```
Client ────────→ Server
       Trust
  "Is this the    ✓ Server cert
   real server?"    verified

❌ Server cannot verify client identity
❌ Vulnerable to unauthorized clients
```

</div>

<div>

### Mutual TLS (Both directions)
```
Client ←────────→ Server
    Mutual Trust
  
  ✓ Server cert     ✓ Client cert
    verified          verified

✅ Both parties authenticated
✅ Strong device identity
```

## Implementation Benefits
- **Device identity** - Each device has unique certificate
- **Access control** - Only authorized devices connect
- **Non-repudiation** - Cryptographic proof of identity
- **Scalable security** - PKI infrastructure
- **Compliance ready** - Meets enterprise security standards

**Key Advantage:** Prevents unauthorized device connections even with network access
