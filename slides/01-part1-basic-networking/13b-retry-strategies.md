# Smart Retry: Strategy Comparison

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

### Naive Retry (Poor)
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Immediate  
Attempt 3: Immediate
Result: Network spam, battery drain
```

### Fixed Delay (Better)
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 1 second
Attempt 3: Wait 1 second
Result: Predictable, but not adaptive
```

</div>

<div>

### Exponential Backoff (Best)
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 1 second
Attempt 3: Wait 2 seconds
Attempt 4: Wait 4 seconds
Result: Adaptive to network conditions
```

### Smart Retry
- **Reason-based**: Different strategies per disconnect cause
- **Progressive backoff**: Increase delays over time
- **Maximum attempts**: Prevent infinite retry loops
- **User notification**: Inform application of failure
