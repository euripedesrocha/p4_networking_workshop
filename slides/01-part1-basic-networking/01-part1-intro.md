## Our Approach: Action â†’ Understanding
1. **Get it working** - WiFi connection in 5 minutes
2. **Understand why** - ESP-NETIF architecture
3. **See the magic** - WiFi Remote component
4. **Build on success** - Extend your working code

## What We'll Build
- Minimal WiFi connection project
- Using ESP-IDF's proven patterns
- **Same approach** as all protocol examples

## Learning Objectives
- **Experience** immediate success with WiFi
- Understand protocol_examples_common pattern
- Learn ESP-NETIF through working code
- See WiFi Remote transparency in action
- **Build confidence** for complex applications

## Tools We'll Use
- `protocol_examples_common` component
- `esp_wifi_remote` for ESP32-P4
- Standard ESP-IDF initialization pattern
